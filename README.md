# Playwright-Automation

//TODO List for Playwright Repository

## 1. Project Setup:

Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., Playwright-Automation).
Choose a language: TypeScript (recommended) or JavaScript.
Initialize the project with npm init -y.
Install Playwright: npm install -D playwright.
Install any necessary testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha): npm install -D jest.
Create basic project structure (e.g., tests, pages, utils).

## 2. Core Framework Features:
Page Object Model (POM):
Create page object classes for key pages of the application under test.
Encapsulate element locators and actions within page objects.
Configuration:
Create a playwright.config.ts or playwright.config.js file.
Configure browsers, test directories, timeout settings, etc.
Test Cases:
Write diverse test cases covering different user scenarios and functionalities.
Use Playwright's API for browser control, navigation, element interactions, and assertions.
Utilities:
Create helper functions for common tasks (e.g., login, data generation, API calls).

## 3. Advanced Features:
Visual Testing:
Use Playwright's visual comparison tools to detect UI regressions.
Configure baselines and thresholds for visual comparisons.
API Testing:
Leverage Playwright's API testing capabilities to make API requests and validate responses.
Cross-Browser Testing:
Configure your tests to run across different browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
Mobile Emulation:
Use Playwright to emulate mobile devices and test responsiveness.
Network Interception:
Intercept network requests to mock API responses or modify headers.
Authentication:
Implement authentication flows (e.g., login, cookies, tokens) in your tests.
Data-Driven Testing:
Use external data sources (e.g., CSV, JSON, Excel) to drive your tests.
CI/CD Integration:
Integrate your Playwright tests with Jenkins or other CI/CD pipelines.

## 4. Documentation
README:
Provide a clear description of the framework and its features.
Include setup instructions and how to run the tests.
Document any custom configurations or utilities.
Code Comments:
Add comments to your code to explain complex logic or functionality.

## 5. Example Test Cases:
Include a variety of sanitized test cases demonstrating different Playwright features and best practices.
Cover common scenarios like login, form submission, navigation, and data validation.

## 6. Best Practices:
Demonstrate good code organization, naming conventions, and modularity.
Use appropriate assertions and error handling.
Write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
